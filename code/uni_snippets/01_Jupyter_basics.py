# This notebook introduces us to the basics of *Jupyter*.
# 
# We can write in **bold**, *italics* or ~~strikethrough~~.
# 
# The most important thing about Jupyter is that we can also write in code.  Let's run some print statements.

# In[1]:


print("Hello world!")
print("How are you?")


# In[2]:


print(2 + 3)


# Besides using `print`, we can also get Jupyter to evaluate the last line of a code block.

# In[3]:


print(2 + 3)
print(4 + 5)


# Don't forget to save your code!

# Finally, let's have a link to the [University website](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk).

# ## Exercise
# Make a new notebook with a short bio of yourself, including a title, some bold and italic font, and a link.  Write Python code to print your name.
